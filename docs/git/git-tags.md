# Git - tags


**What are GitHub tags?**

A Git tag is similar to a Git reference, but the Git commit that it points to never changes. Git tags are helpful when you want to point to specific releases. These endpoints allow you to read and write tag objects to your Git database on GitHub. The API only supports annotated tag objects, not lightweight tags.
